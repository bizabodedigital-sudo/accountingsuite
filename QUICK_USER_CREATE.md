# Quick User Creation

Run this simpler script in Coolify Backend Terminal:

```bash
cd /app
node src/scripts/create-user.js
```

This script:
- ✅ Creates tenant if it doesn't exist
- ✅ Creates owner user if it doesn't exist
- ✅ Resets password if user exists
- ✅ Verifies password works
- ✅ Shows clear success message

Much simpler than the full seed script - just creates what you need to login!
